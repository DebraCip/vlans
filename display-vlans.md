# Display your VLANs

VLANs are displayed on the VLANs screen in the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/). Each VLAN has details associated with it, including the router, location, and associated devices and subnets. All of these details may be viewed by displaying the VLANs screen. Follow these steps: 

* Navigate to the **VLANs** screen. Refer to [Use the VLANs Screen](vlans-screen.html){:new_window}.
* Click the **VLAN Number** link for the desired VLAN.

## What Happens Next

After displaying a VLAN, you may [edit the VLAN name](edit-vlan.html), view and manage devices associated with the VLAN, and view and manage associated subnets. Devices and subnets may be displayed for editing by clicking the link for the desired device or subnet. Return to the VLANs screen at any time by clicking the **View all VLANs** link at the top of the screen or the appropriate **VLAN Number** link if viewing details at the device or subnet level.
