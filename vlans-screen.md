# Use the VLANs Screen

VLANs are managed within the Customer Portal on the VLANs screen. From the VLANs screen, VLAN spanning may be enabled or disabled, the VLAN name may be edited, firewalls may be added, and the VLAN may be updated or cancelled. Follow these steps  to display the VLANs screen in the Customer Portal:

1. Open the [IBM Cloud console ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.bluemix.net/){: new_window} and log into your account.
2. In the menu, select **Infrastructure**.
3. In the Customer Portal navigation, select **Network > IP Management > VLANs**.

## What Happens Next

You may enable or disable VLAN spanning, manage a VLAN, cancel a VLAN, or edit a VLAN name from the VLANs screen. While a VLAN is displayed, you can view and manage the VLAN's associated devices or subnets. You can use the VLANs screen again at any time by repeating the steps in this section.
