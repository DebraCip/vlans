# Use the VLANs Screen

VLANs are managed within the Customer Portal on the VLANs screen. From the VLANs screen, VLAN spanning may be enabled or disabled, the VLAN name may be edited, firewalls may be added, and the VLAN may be updated or cancelled. Follow these steps  to display the VLANs screen in the Customer Portal:

 * Log in to the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/)using your unique credentials.
 * Select **Network > IP Management > VLANs** from the Navigation Bar to display the VLANs screen.

## What Happens Next

You may enable or disable VLAN spanning, manage a VLAN, cancel a VLAN, or edit a VLAN name from the VLANs screen. Additional While a VLAN is displayed, you can view and manage the VLAN's associated devices or subnets. You can use the VLANs screen again at any time by repeating the steps above.
