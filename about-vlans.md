# More about VLANs

A VLAN, or Virtual LAN, is an isolated partition created at the OSI Layer 2, the _data link layer_, of a network. The VLAN lets a datacenter keep each customer's data separate, even though the workloads might be running on physical equipment that is shared in the same datacenter. VLAN membership can be configured through software, and it is generally accepted industry practice to use VLANs to separate every customers' private zones from each other.

For more information about VLANs, please refer to [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN).
